Hi! I'm Uday Shankar, a senior studying Computer Science and Mathematics at Carnegie Mellon
University.

# Hobbies

- **Bouldering:** Unfortunately this has been on a hold for a while now due to safety concerns with the virus, but I got into bouldering in August 2019 and enjoy it a lot. Currently I climb at ~V3.
- **Music:** I enjoy listening to music, mostly pieces taken from video games/tv shows/anime.
- **Video Games:** Some of my favorite titles are Breath of the Wild, FTL: Faster Than Light, and Super Smash Brothers Melee.
- **Exploit Development:** Recently, I've gotten back into binary exploit development (which I was first introduced to via CTF competitions in high school) and have been thinking about doing writeups for some of the more interesting challenges I've solved.
